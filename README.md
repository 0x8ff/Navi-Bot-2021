### Note
I don't provide support with running custom instances of my bot, if something doesn't work out of the box, please don't contact me.

## Getting Bot Up & Running
First install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord /
pip install python-dotenv
```
Then store the bot token in a file named .env like so:
```sh
BOT_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>
```
Make sure to change ``<BOT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>`` to the actual bot token, after that go into the src file and run:
```sh
/usr/bin/python bot.py
```
You're all set up after this!!
